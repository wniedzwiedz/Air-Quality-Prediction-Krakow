# Air-Quality-Prediction-Krakow

In this project, historical data pertaining to air pollution collected by one of the air pollution sensors in Kraków was used to predict its upcoming values. 

Multiple of the documented pollutants were the subject of separate predictions, namely PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and O3. As a result, a yearly prediction of each was obtained, as well as a prediction of the value of the overall air quality index commonly used in Poland - Indeks Jakości Powietrza (IJP).

The data used in predictions is sourced from the databases of Główny Inspektorat Ochrony Środowiska. They collect hourly measurements of various pollutants from multiple sensors located in most urban areas in Poland, including Kraków.
